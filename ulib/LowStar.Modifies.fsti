/// The modifies clause for regions, references and buffers.
/// ==========================================================
///
/// This module presents the modifies clause, a way to track the set
/// of memory locations modified by a stateful Low* (or even F*)
/// program. The basic principle of modifies clauses is that any
/// location that is disjoint from a set of memory locations modified
/// by an operation is preserved by that operation.
///
/// We start by specifying a monoid of sets of memory locations. From
/// a rough high-level view, ``loc`` is the type of sets of memory
/// locations, equipped with an identity element ``loc_none``,
/// representing the empty set, and an associative and commutative
/// operator, ``loc_union``, representing the union of two sets of
/// memory locations.
///
/// Moreover, ``loc_union`` is idempotent, which is useful to cut SMT
/// matching loops with ``modifies_trans`` and ``modifies_refl`` below.
