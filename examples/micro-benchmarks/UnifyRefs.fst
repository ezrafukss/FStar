(* These tests SHOULD NOT REALLY FAIL!
 *
 * We're just *admitting* them for now, until we fix #606. Related: #1345.
 *
 * Keeping them in here, and thus CI, is a good way to not forget and to
 * not inadvertedly change the situation. If you find some test starts
 * passing, (and therefore failing due to the @expect_failure) that's good, just
 * remove the @expect_failure.
 *
 * Do try to not add back any @fail's, please.
